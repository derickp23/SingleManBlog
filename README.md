# SingleManBlog
I created a blog webpage to have fun and help develop my web development skills. My project utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Json, and an API. The website has full functionality and was designed for entertainment. The website is designed with mobile display in mind.  
My first feature is "Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)". Towards the bottom of the webpage I have created a Joke Generator function that displays a joke on my page. When you click on the Joke Generator button a joke from JokeAPI is fetched and displayed at the bottom of the page.
A second feature is "Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app". At the bottom of the page you will see the Tips button. On click, the Tips button will display Json data.
A third feature is “Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application”. My Tips button retrieves data from a Json file and randomly displays the Tips/Quotes on button click.  
 
Enjoy the webpage :)
